# Libgamemode.sh Not found

Error: libgamemode.so Not Found

If you encounter an error like this when launching a Steam game with GameMode:

gamemodeauto: dlopen failed - libgamemode.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Follow the steps below to resolve the issue.

Find Path of libgamemode.so

Run this command to find the path to your libgamemode.so file:

find /nix/store -name "libgamemode.so"

You'll get an output similar to /nix/store/.../libgamemode.so.0.

Modify Steam Launch Options

Add the following to the game's launch options, replacing the path as necessary:

LD_PRELOAD="$LD_PRELOAD:/nix/store/.../libgamemode.so.0" gamemoderun %command%
